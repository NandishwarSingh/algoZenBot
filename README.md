AlgoZenBot is a fun and interactive bot designed for engaging users in a quiz game on Discord servers. The bot periodically initiates a quiz where users can answer multiple-choice questions and earn points. These points are tracked on a leaderboard, allowing users to compete for the top spot.

Users can view the leaderboard by typing  !leaderboard  in the designated quiz channel.

Updates:- 1. Shop has been added and now users can purchase a special role with points they have collected by answering the quiz
2. !points added and now users can check out their points without calling leaderboard
3. !gamble add and now users can gamble to lose the gambled amount or double the gambled amount
4. Questions are now Dynnamically generated with gemini API instead of Being Hardcoded

Note :-

1. A Quiz Spawns After every 30 messages in the ‚Å†üí¨general-chat

2. Bot messages are not counted

3. New Features Coming Soon !

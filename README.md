AlgoZenBot is a fun and interactive bot designed for engaging users in a quiz game on Discord servers. The bot periodically initiates a quiz where users can answer multiple-choice questions and earn points. These points are tracked on a leaderboard, allowing users to compete for the top spot.

Users can view the leaderboard by typing  !leaderboard  in the designated quiz channel.
